    "- **Certainty Equivalent (CE)**: The guaranteed amount of money that an investor considers equivalent to a risky gamble. It's the amount where the investor is indifferent between the certain payment and the risky gamble.\n",
    "- **Risk Premium (RP)**: The difference between the expected return of the risky gamble and the certainty equivalent. It represents the extra amount an investor needs to be willing to participate in the risky gamble.\n",
    "- **Utility Function**: In this case, $u(W) = \\ln(W)$, where $W$ is wealth. This function represents the investor's satisfaction or utility with different levels of wealth.\n",

    "We can calculate the expected utility of the gamble, find the certainty equivalent by equating the expected utility to the utility of the certainty equivalent, and then calculate the risk premium.

    "3. Calculate the *risk premium* as the difference between the expected wealth and the certainty equivalent.\n",
    "4. Compare the *exact expected utility* to the approximation obtained by using a *Taylor series expansion* around the initial wealth."
