## FE630 - Portfolio Theory & Applications

This repository contains all the materials for the course FE630 - Portfolio Theory & Applications, including code, assignments, and notes.

### Course Goals

This course offers an introduction to quantitative portfolio theory, practice, optimization, and management. It aims to provide students with an understanding of investor choice, market opportunities, and optimal portfolio selection. The course examines security covariance and return models, performance analysis, and return attribution, and introduces basic methods for robust portfolio construction. A significant computational component is included, where students will construct optimal portfolios, track their behavior, and analyze their performance.

### Student Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:
- Compute Absolute Risk Aversion (ARA), Certainty Equivalent of Risky (CER) of risky gamble, and Risk-premiums.
- Solve Optimal Decision Problems arising in Modern Portfolio Theory and implement the solutions using a high-level language such as R, Matlab, or Python.
- Design Markowitz efficient portfolios and use the One-fund Theorem and the Two-fund theorem for building efficient Portfolios with Target Return or Target Risk.
- Use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and Factor Model to compute security Expected Returns and their Risk and Covariance.
- Apply Markowitz Allocation to design, implement, and backtest Optimal Portfolios using historical price time series, analyze the sensitivity to various inputs, and manage Fixed Income portfolios.
