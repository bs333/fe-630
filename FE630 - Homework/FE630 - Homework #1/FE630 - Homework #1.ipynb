    "1. *What is the Certainty Equivalent of this risky game?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Certainty Equivalent (CE) of this risky game is $\\bf{-\\$8.28}$. This means that the investor would be indifferent between accepting a certain outcome that effectively reduces their wealth to $991.72 ($1000 - $8.28) and taking the gamble with the potential to win $350 or lose $150. The negative value of the CE indicates that, according to the investor's utility function (which is the natural logarithm of wealth in this case), they perceive the gamble as having a net negative effect on their utility compared to their initial position, even though the game is \"fair\" in terms of expected monetary value. This highlights the risk-averse nature of the utility function, where the potential loss weighs more heavily on the decision than the equivalent potential gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *What is the exact Risk Premium of this risky game?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Risk Premium (RP) for this game is approximately $\\bf{\\$24.94}$. This is the amount the investor would require as compensation to be indifferent between taking the gamble and not participating, based on their initial wealth of $1000. It represents the monetary value of the risk associated with the gamble to the investor. Since the gamble has a negative certainty equivalent, the risk premium indicates how much the investor values certainty over the possibility of the outcomes provided by the gamble. In simpler terms, it's the price the investor is willing to pay to avoid the risk, reflecting their aversion to the gamble's uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *How good is the approximation obtained by using a Taylor series expansion?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximation of the expected utility using a Taylor series expansion is **quite good**. The exact expected utility (EU) calculated is **6.8994**, while the Taylor series expected utility approximation (EU_approx) is **6.9243**. The difference between them is minimal, indicating that the Taylor series expansion provides a close approximation to the actual expected utility for this particular setup. This suggests that for small changes in wealth (such as those involved in this gamble, relative to the investor's initial wealth), the Taylor series expansion around the initial wealth effectively captures the utility function's curvature and provides a reliable estimate of the expected utility."

    "Given the initial wealth increase to $\\$2000$ and applying the previously defined Python code, the risk premium for this new scenario is approximately $\\bf{\\$13.10}$. This result indicates how sensitive the investor's risk aversion is to changes in initial wealth. With an initial wealth of $\\$2000$, the investor perceives the gamble to be less risky compared to when the initial wealth was $\\$1000$, hence the lower risk premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decrease in the risk premium with an increase in initial wealth can be attributed to the utility function's properties, which in this case is a logarithmic function. The logarithmic utility function exhibits **diminishing marginal utility**, meaning that as wealth increases, the utility gained from an additional dollar becomes less significant. Consequently, the investor's aversion to losing a certain amount of money diminishes as their wealth increases, leading to a lower risk premium for the gamble at higher levels of initial wealth."
