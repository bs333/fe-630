    "### 1.1 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project to build and compare *two factor-based long short allocation models* with constraints on their *betas*. The first strategy considers a **target Beta** in the interval $[-0.5, 0.5]$, while the second has a target Beta in the interval $[-2, +2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy operates similar to a **Value-at-Risk Utility** corresponding to **Robust Optimization**; the second strategy incorporates an **Information Ratio** term to limit the deviations from a benchmark, provided those deviations yield a 'high return.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimization models are built, we want to *compare* the outcomes of the two models while simultaneously evaluating their sensitivity to the *length* of the estimators for the **covariance matrix** in tandem with the **expected returns** under various market regimes/scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Reallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolios will be *reallocated* or, in other words, 'reoptimized' weekly from the beginning of **March 2007** to the end of **March 2024**. Our *investment universe* encompasses a set of exchange-traded funds (**ETFs**) which is large enough to represent the '**Global World Economy**' (as according to some).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize the [Famaâ€“French Three-Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model) which incorporates the following factors:\n",
    "- Momentum\n",
    "- Value\n",
    "- Size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding data accessability, these factors have historical values available for ***free*** from ***Ken French's*** [personal website](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/) in tandem with Yahoo Finance."
