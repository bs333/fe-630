    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project to build and compare *two factor-based long short allocation models* with constraints on their *betas*. The first strategy considers a **target Beta** in the interval $[-0.5, 0.5]$, while the second has a target Beta in the interval $[-2, +2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy operates similar to a **Value-at-Risk Utility** corresponding to **Robust Optimization**; the second strategy incorporates an **Information Ratio** term to limit the deviations from a benchmark, provided those deviations yield a 'high return.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimization models are built, we want to *compare* the outcomes of the two models while simultaneously evaluating their sensitivity to the *length* of the estimators for the **covariance matrix** in tandem with the **expected returns** under various market regimes/scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Reallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolios will be *reallocated* or, in other words, 'reoptimized' weekly from the beginning of **March 2007** to the end of **March 2024**. Our *investment universe* encompasses a set of exchange-traded funds (**ETFs**) which is large enough to represent the '**Global World Economy**' (as according to some).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize the [Fama–French Three-Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model) which incorporates the following factors:\n",
    "- [Momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing)\n",
    "- [Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing)\n",
    "- [Size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding data accessability, these factors have historical values available for ***free*** from ***Ken French's*** [personal website](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/) in tandem with Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the performance as well as the risk profiles of the aforementioned strategies may be (relatively) sensitive to the *target Beta* and the (current) market environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a '**low Beta**' (essentially) means that a strategy is created with the objective or aim to be '**decorrelated**' (no linear relationship between entites) with the 'Global Market,' which, in our case, is represented by the **S&P 500** (i.e., no *systematic relationship*).\n",
    "\n",
    "A '**high Beta**' is simply the antithesis, or opposite, of what we just discussed. In layman's terms, we have a (higher) appetite for '*risk*' (in this case, let's keep it simple and define our premise as $\\sigma$ or **standard deviation**) and desire to ride or 'scale up' the *market risk* (**systematic risk**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it's imperative that one acknowledges that such a (described) strategy is more probable to be (quite) sensitive to the *estimators* used for the **Risk Model** and the **Alpha Model** (e.g., the length of the *look-back period* utilized); therefore, it is necessary to understand and, most importantly, *comprehend* the impact of said estimators on the **Portfolio's** characteristics:\n",
    "- (Realized) [Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) : $\\mu_h$\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Historical) [Volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)) : $\\sigma_h$\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) : $(\\mathbb{E}[(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma})^3]) = \\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma_3} = \\frac{\\kappa_3}{\\kappa_2^{3/2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- [VaR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) / [Expected Shortfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_shortfall)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) : $S_a = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[R_a - R_b]}{\\sigma_a} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[R_a - R_b]}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}(R_a - R_b)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier, we assume that once the **Factor Model** (FM) has been constructed, we will use [trend following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following) estimators for the **Expected Returns**. Since the quality of the estimators depend on the **look-back period**, we define three cases:\n",
    "- ***Long-Term Estimator (LTE)*** : $\\text{LT} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{180 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$.\n",
    "- ***Mid-Term Estimator (MTE)*** : $\\text{MT} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{90 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$.\n",
    "- ***Short-Term Estimator (STE)*** : $\\text{ST} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{40 \\; \\text{Days}, 60 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we define a **Term-Structure** for the $\\text{Covariance} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and $\\text{Expected Return} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "To (briefly) summarize, the behavior of a (potential) '*optimal*' portfolio built from a melting pot of *estimators* for **Covariance** and **Expected Return** may vary according to the cadence of the '**Market**' (environment/regime) or an aforementioned strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the (mathematical) notation $S_{40}^{90}$ is just fancy jargon to visually illustrate that we are using **40 days** for the covariance estimation and **90 days** for the expected returns estimations—it's not that deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal of this fun, entertaining project is to conceptualize, visualize, understand, analyze, and compare the behavior of our ideas; we want to *see* if we can (actually) make some $\\boldsymbol{\\$\\$\\$}$, especially during momentous, historical (time) periods such as the **Subprime Mortgage Crisis** of *2008*, the horrendous commencement of **Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Disease** of *2019*, et cetera."
