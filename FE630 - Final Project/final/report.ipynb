    "# Quantitative Strategy Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents the findings and conclusions about the impact of the estimators on the behavior of two strategies: Strategy I and Strategy II. It analyzes the performance of these strategies during different market periods, including crisis periods such as the subprime crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis focuses on the sensitivity to the term-structure of estimators (short-term, mid-term, and long-term) for covariance and expected returns, as well as sensitivity to the target βT.\n",

    "## 5. Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategy I and Strategy II** now show different performance metrics across all periods, reflecting their distinct optimization approaches.\n",
    "- **Benchmark (SPY)** consistently demonstrated higher cumulative returns compared to both strategies in most periods, indicating stronger performance.\n",
    "- **Max Drawdown** was highest during the subprime crisis (Period 2), highlighting significant portfolio risk.\n",
    "- **Sharpe Ratios** and **Volatility** metrics indicate that the Benchmark (SPY) often provided better risk-adjusted returns.\n",
    "- **Skewness and Kurtosis** values suggest varying degrees of return distribution asymmetry and tail risk, which are critical for assessing portfolio stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the strategies performed as expected with varying degrees of success in different market conditions. The analysis highlights the importance of robust risk management, particularly during periods of high market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for the use of estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short-Term Estimators**: Recommended during highly volatile market conditions, such as during crisis periods (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). They provide more reactive adjustments to rapid market changes.\n",
    "2. **Mid-Term Estimators**: Suitable for relatively stable market conditions with moderate volatility. They balance the need for responsiveness and stability.\n",
    "3. **Long-Term Estimators**: Preferred for long-term investment strategies where market conditions are relatively stable. They provide smoother estimates that reduce noise from short-term market fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity to βT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low βT Sensitivity**: Use during periods of high market volatility to minimize exposure to market risk.\n",
    "- **High βT Sensitivity**: Suitable when the market is stable, allowing for higher exposure to market movements to capture potential gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations ensure that the chosen estimators and sensitivity levels align with the prevailing market conditions and investment goals."
