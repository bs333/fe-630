    "## 1 $\\,$ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project to build and compare two factor-based long short allocation models with constraints on their betas. The first strategy considers a target Beta in the interval $[-0.5, 0.5]$ while the second has one in the interval $[-2, +2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy operates similar to a Value-at-Risk Utility corresponding to Robust Optimization; the second strategy incorporates an Information Ratio term to limit the deviations from a benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimization models are built, I will compare the outcomes of the two models while simultaneously evaluating their sensitivity to the length of the estimators for the covariance matrix in tandem with the expected returns under various market regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Reallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolios will be reallocated weekly from the beginning of March 2007 to the end of March 2024. My investment universe encompasses a set of ETFs to represent the 'Global World Economy.'\n",
    "\n",
    "I will utilize the Fama–French Three-Factor Model $(\\text{Momentum, Value, Size})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance and risk profiles of the strategies are sensitive to the target Beta and the market environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low Beta indicates decorrelation with the 'Global Market;' a high Beta is the antithesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it's imperative that one acknowledges that such a (described) strategy is more probable to be (quite) sensitive to the *estimators* used for the **Risk Model** and the **Alpha Model** (e.g., the length of the *look-back period* utilized); therefore, it is necessary to understand and, most importantly, *comprehend* the impact of said estimators on the **Portfolio's** characteristics:\n",
    "- (Realized) [Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) : $\\mu_h$\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Historical) [Volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)) : $\\sigma_h$\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) : $(\\mathbb{E}[(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma})^3]) = \\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma_3} = \\frac{\\kappa_3}{\\kappa_2^{3/2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- [VaR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) / [Expected Shortfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_shortfall)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) : $S_a = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[R_a - R_b]}{\\sigma_a} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[R_a - R_b]}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}(R_a - R_b)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier, we assume that once the **Factor Model** (FM) has been constructed, we will use [trend following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following) estimators for the **Expected Returns**. Since the quality of the estimators depend on the **look-back period**, we define three cases:\n",
    "- ***Long-Term Estimator (LTE)*** : $\\text{LT} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{180 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$.\n",
    "- ***Mid-Term Estimator (MTE)*** : $\\text{MT} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{90 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$.\n",
    "- ***Short-Term Estimator (STE)*** : $\\text{ST} \\Rightarrow \\text{LB} \\in \\{40 \\; \\text{Days}, 60 \\; \\text{Days}\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we define a **Term-Structure** for the $\\text{Covariance} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and $\\text{Expected Return} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "To (briefly) summarize, the behavior of a (potential) '*optimal*' portfolio built from a melting pot of *estimators* for **Covariance** and **Expected Return** may vary according to the cadence of the '**Market**' (environment/regime) or an aforementioned strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the (mathematical) notation $S_{40}^{90}$ is implemented to illustrate that we are using **40 days** for the covariance estimation and **90 days** for the expected returns estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal of this experiment is to conceptualize, visualize, understand, analyze, and compare the behavior of our hypotheses; we want to see if we can deliver robust risk-adjusted performance, especially during momentous, historical periods such as the **Subprime Mortgage Crisis** of *2008*, the horrendous commencement of **Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Disease** of *2019*, et cetera."
